**AuraFlow** is a highly performant, modular, and scriptable C application designed for the elegant visualization and complex analysis of real-time data streams. Built with efficiency and extensibility at its core, AuraFlow aims to provide a beautiful and intuitive interface for scientists, engineers, analysts, and hobbyists to explore and understand their data like never before.

It leverages modern C, powerful graphics libraries like Raylib/OpenGL, and the flexibility of Lua scripting to create a truly unique tool for real-world applications.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Real-time Data Ingestion:** Connect to various data sources (files, network streams, custom collectors) via a robust plugin system.
*   **Diverse Visualization Suite:** Display data using a range of built-in and plugin-extendable visualizations:
    *   Line charts, scatter plots, bar charts
    *   Heatmaps, Spectrograms
    *   Custom 2D/3D renderings (leveraging Raylib/OpenGL)
*   **Interactive Exploration:** Fluid zooming, panning, data point selection, dynamic filtering, and time-windowing.
*   **Modular Data Processing Pipeline:** Chain together processing nodes (filters, transformers, statistical analyzers) to refine and derive insights from raw data.
*   **Elegant & Customizable UI:**
    *   Built with Dear ImGui for a responsive and developer-friendly interface.
    *   Themable: Customize colors, fonts, and layout to your preference.
    *   Focus on clarity and minimizing distractions.
*   **Deep Scriptability with Lua:**
    *   Automate complex workflows.
    *   Define custom data transformations and processing logic.
    *   Dynamically create or modify UI elements.
    *   React to data events and thresholds.
*   **Efficient C Core:** Optimized for performance and low-latency processing, making it suitable for high-throughput data.
*   **Plugin Architecture:** Extend AuraFlow's capabilities by creating custom C plugins for:
    *   Data Sources
    *   Visualization Widgets
    *   Data Processing Algorithms
*   **Project-Based Workflow:** Save and load complex dashboard layouts, data connections, and processing configurations.

## üí° Why AuraFlow?

In a world inundated with data, the tools to interpret it effectively are paramount. AuraFlow aims to be:

*   **Performant:** Handle large datasets and high-frequency updates without breaking a sweat, thanks to its C core.
*   **Customizable:** Tailor the application to your specific domain and needs through plugins and scripting. No more "one-size-fits-all" limitations.
*   **Extensible:** The plugin API allows developers to contribute new functionalities, keeping the tool growing and adapting.
*   **Transparent:** Understand how your data is processed and visualized, with the option to dive into the source.
*   **Beautiful:** We believe that data tools don't have to be ugly. AuraFlow strives for an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A C compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
*   CMake (3.15+)
*   Raylib development libraries (or SDL2, depending on final choice)
*   Lua development libraries (5.4+)

### Building from Source

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auraflow.git
cd auraflow

# 2. Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# 3. Configure with CMake
#    (You might need to specify paths to Raylib/Lua if not found automatically)
cmake ..
# Example with custom paths:
# cmake .. -DRAYLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/raylib/include -DRAYLIB_LIBRARY=/path/to/libraylib.a \
#          -DLUA_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/lua/include -DLUA_LIBRARY=/path/to/liblua.a

# 4. Build the project
cmake --build .
# or 'make' on Linux/macOS

# 5. Run AuraFlow
./src/auraflow  # Or equivalent path to the executable
